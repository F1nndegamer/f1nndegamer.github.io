            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Unity C# developer who has led teams in creating games. My skills include working with Unity,
                GitHub, and multiple programming languages like C#, CSS, and HTML. I am mostly self-taught, learning and
                improving with each project.

                    <p>A game made with 5 people, 2 of them joined later in the jam. We had to manage the work a bit
                        with school and our idea was a bit too ambigious, but it turned out nicely</p>

                    <p>This game was a bit different, I wasn't the team leader and I worked with a Turkish team. With
                        time zones and the language barrier, communication was hard. We overcame these challenges, and
                        made a fun game.</p>
